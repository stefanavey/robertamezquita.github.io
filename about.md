Serving as a Teaching Fellow for the Introduction to Immunobiology and Genomics Methods courses in the 2013-2014 academic year, Robert is intimately familiar with the challenges of introducing “big data” concepts to non-computational audiences, particularly in the realm of biology. Robert hails from the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. He is a proud father to two adorable “Pomimo” puppies, a part-time sous chef with his new fiance, and loves technology, football, and the great outdoors.
